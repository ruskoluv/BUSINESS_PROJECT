# BUSINESS_PROJECT
This program simulates a business where you can enter in different employees (either paid by the hour or by  a salary)
and calculate gross pays of the period. This was a project we did in class to illustrate public inheritance in C++. 
We had to work with code already given to us on a linux server (not available here) and derive the different types of employees 
from an employee class already given. Everything here I wrote. This project demonstrates: use of protected data members(for inheritance),
operator overloading, ability to work with already running and working code and to build ontop of that, and general class creation
with inheritance in C++.
